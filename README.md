# Defend Against the Roomba Offensive

## Problem Question
How can I entertain Saad with a simple game including mechs (a robot suit often portrayed in movies and tv as mechanical suites worn for combat) and roombas (a small circular robot used in houses to vacuum and clean the floors) while he is on the subway?

### Project Description
My client is a student at Brooklyn Friends High School in New York named Saad. Sometimes on the subway he wants a simple game he can play while on his way and while listening to music. He won't be able use this game on the subway but if I succeed in developing the desktop game maybe I can develop a mobile version as well. And in light of recent events (primarily the COVID-19 pandemic) a desktop game to keep people busy during quarentine will be especially helpful. In the game I plan on developing, you are a mech suit (which Saad find cool) and surrounded by roombas that want to destroy you. Before that happens you must destroy them by clicking on them. As the game goes on, more roombas appear and they move faster.

### Scenario
My client Saad is a fellow student here at Brooklyn Friends Highschool. He is one of my closest friends and for that reason easily accessable by phone. Because we attend the same school I also see him every school day. In my interview with Saad you will see that Saad is interested in a basic but entertaining and fun game that he can play when he is bored. I have also selected Saad as my advisor. Because he will be both my client and advisor, he can critic my game as it is and I can get regular feedback to better mold the project to his liking. Another reason is because he is very good at coding due to him aspiring to go into the field when he is older. So if needed he can point out flaws in my code. 

### Interview 1
Q1: How often do you take take the subway?

A1: Everyday 2-3 times a day depending on the day and how much I am doing.

Q2: What types of games do you like playing on the subway?

A2: Simple games that I don't have to concentrate much on so I can listen to music at the same time and relax.

Q3: When else are you bored and need a game to play?

A3: On the weekend at times. Also when I'm on the way to a soccer game or waiting for Lucien (our soccer coach) to get on the bus.

### Interview 2 (post-COVID)
Q1: Do you still take the subway often?

A1: No where near as often.

Q2: Do you get bored more easily in quarentine?

A2: For sure, there just isn't as much to do now so I get bored alot.

### Rationale
Following the interview, I proposed an idea for a game which he seemed to like. The product will be a game called Defend Against the Roomba Offensive. In the game there will be multiple levels. In each level the character will be in a mech and have to destroy roombas (by clicking them) as they move to take your hearts to the edges of the screen. There will be 3 hearts in the middle of the screen that are stationary unless a roomba gets to the middle and transports it off the screen. When a robot picks up a heart its movents change. As the levels progress so does the speed of the roombas. If you lose all your hearts you loose and if your mech gets ran into by 3 roombas you also loose. I will be use Java to code it. I decided to code in Java because it is the language I am most comfortable with. It offers everything needed to create a successful product. Java would also allow for the game to run on different devices, even the iphone. Its high-level concurrency tools would also greatly benefit the project.

### Success Criteria
- The client can play again and again
- The client can destroy the roombas
- The roombas can enter and take a heart
- The roombas movement changes after taking a heart
- The roombas can win
- The game gets progressively harder
