# Defend Against the Roomba Offensive

## Problem Question
How can I entertain Saad with a simple game including mechs while he is on the subway?

### Project Description
My client is Saad, he is a student at Brooklyn Friends High School. Sometimes on the subway he wants a simple game he can play while on his way and while listening to music. He won't be able to with this game but if it does really well maybe I can develop a mobile version. In the game you are in a mech suit and surrounded by roombas that want to destroy you. Before that happens you must destroy them by clicking on them. As the game goes on, more roombas appear and they move faster.
